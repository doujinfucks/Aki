A discord bot suited for moderation, socializing, and fun. Fully written in Typescript for strong typings and minimal errors. Fun little side project to mess around with. If you want a more finished example check out [my other bot](https://github.com/longshotdev/rice-bot) but it's probably pretty scuffed lmao I haven't updated it in a while.
